// To display an image in HTML, you can use the < img > tag.There are several ways to display images in HTML, including online images, local images, and folder images.

// Online Image: To display an image from a website, you can use the image's URL as the value of the src attribute in the <img> tag. For example:


//     < img src = "https://www.example.com/image.jpg" alt = "Image" >
//         The alt attribute specifies the alternate text to be displayed if the image cannot be loaded.

// Local Image: To display an image that is stored locally on your computer, you can use the relative file path as the value of the src attribute.For example:


//     < img src = "images/image.jpg" alt = "Image" >
//         This assumes that the image is stored in a folder called images in the same directory as the HTML file.

// Folder Image: To display an image that is stored in a different folder, you can use a relative file path that includes the folder name.For example:


//     < img src = "assets/images/image.jpg" alt = "Image" >
//         This assumes that the image is stored in a folder called images within a folder called assets in the same directory as the HTML file.

// Remember to always specify an alt attribute for your images, as it helps with accessibility and search engine optimization.
