// In HTML, you can format text within a paragraph using various tags, including < strong > and < em >.

//     The < strong > tag is used to make text bold, which typically indicates emphasis or importance.For example, if you want to emphasize a particular word or phrase within a paragraph, you could wrap it in the < strong > tag, like this:

//     < p > Did you < strong > really</ > eat all the pizza ?</p >
//         This would make the word "really" bold in the rendered paragraph.

//             The < em > tag is used to make text italicized, which typically indicates stress or importance.For example, if you want to emphasize a particular word or phrase within a sentence, you could wrap it in the < em > tag, like this:


//     < p > The rainforest is < em > critically important</ > to the health of our planet.</p >
//         This would make the phrase "critically important" italicized in the rendered paragraph.

//             It's worth noting that the <strong> and <em> tags should be used semantically, meaning that they should be used to convey meaning or purpose, rather than just for visual styling. For example, you should use the <strong> tag to indicate important information, not just to make text look bold. Similarly, you should use the <em> tag to indicate stress or emphasis, not just to make text look italicized.
